            <p>He insists his betting genius was awakened during the 2007 Kentucky Derby, where he felt a mysterious warmth in his plums that led him to place his first big wager on a 50-to-1 longshot. The horse came through, and Ashley's life was forever changed. From that moment on, his plums became his guiding force, inspiring a betting career as bold and outrageous as his personality.</p>
            
            <p>He developed a unique betting philosophy: ignore the numbers and trust the plums. He claims his plums can sense value in underdogs, spot live-game trends, and even predict game-winning plays. His system, affectionately called "Plumology," has led to legendary wins.</p>
